Climate Change Impact on Agriculture Dashboard
Description
This Tableau dashboard provides an interactive and data-driven exploration of how climate change impacts agriculture worldwide. The visualizations highlight key metrics such as average temperature, total precipitation, CO2 emissions, crop yield, extreme weather events, and economic impact. The dashboard is designed to help policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders understand regional disparities and make informed decisions to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture.

Data Sources
The data used in this dashboard comes from a climate impact dataset that includes the following features:

Year: The year of the data record.
Country: The country where the data was collected.
Region: The geographical region.
Crop_Type: The type of crop analyzed.
Average_Temperature_C: The average temperature in Celsius.
Total_Precipitation_mm: The total precipitation in millimeters.
CO2_Emissions_MT: The carbon dioxide emissions in metric tons.
Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA: The crop yield in metric tons per hectare.
Extreme_Weather_Events: The number of extreme weather events reported.
Irrigation_Access_%: The percentage of crop area with access to irrigation.
Pesticide_Use_KG_per_HA: The amount of pesticide used per hectare in kilograms.
Fertilizer_Use_KG_per_HA: The amount of fertilizer used per hectare in kilograms.
Soil_Health_Index: A score indicating the health of the soil.
Adaptation_Strategies: Strategies implemented to adapt to climate change.
Economic_Impact_Million_USD: The economic impact in million USD.

Insights and Findings

Here are some key insights from the analysis:
Geographical Hotspots: Certain regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, experience significant economic losses and lower crop yields due to extreme weather events and rising temperatures.
CO2 Emissions and Crop Yield: There is a noticeable correlation between higher CO2 emissions and reduced crop yields in some regions, suggesting the adverse impact of greenhouse gases on agricultural productivity.
Economic Impact: Countries highly dependent on agriculture are the most economically affected, with losses amounting to millions of USD.
Adaptation Strategies: Regions with higher adoption of irrigation and soil conservation techniques appear to fare better in terms of crop yield and economic resilience.

Future Work

Additional Data Integration: Incorporate more datasets, such as policy measures or technological innovations, to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning models to predict future impacts of climate change on agriculture.
User Interaction: Enhance the dashboard's interactivity for a better user experience.
